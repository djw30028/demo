== Spring Boot H2 Flyway

Use Flyway as doc:    
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-jdbc

This sample demonstrates the flyway auto-configuration support.

# compile
mvn clean package

# Run
java -jar target/spring-boot-h2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.ja

You can look at `http://localhost:8080/flyway` to review the list of scripts.

This sample also enables the H2 console (at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`)
so that you can review the state of the database (the default jdbc url is
`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`).
